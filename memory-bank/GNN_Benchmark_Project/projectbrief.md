# Project Brief: Network Intrusion Detection with Graph Neural Networks

## Project Goal
Develop, evaluate, and benchmark graph-based deep learning models for network intrusion detection across multiple cybersecurity datasets to assess their generalization capabilities.

## Core Requirements
1. Process network traffic data into graph representations
2. Implement and evaluate various Graph Neural Network architectures:
   - Basic models: GCN, GAT, GraphSAGE
   - Advanced models: E-GraphSage, CAGN-GAT, Anomal-E (with DGI)
3. Evaluate models across multiple standard network intrusion datasets
4. Compare performance with baseline methods
5. Identify optimal model configurations for different attack types
6. Assess model generalization capabilities

## Current Status
