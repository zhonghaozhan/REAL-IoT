# AI Agent Rules for Network Intrusion Detection Project

## Path Management
- Always use relative paths for accessing dataset files
- Dataset files should be referenced as `kaggle/input/...` not `/kaggle/input/...`
- When moving between machines, update paths in memory bank

## Code Execution Patterns
- For large datasets, use smaller samples during development (e.g., KDDTrain+_20Percent.txt)
- Save intermediate results to avoid reprocessing
- Ensure consistent preprocessing across notebooks
- When editing model parameters, document changes in activeWorkflow.md

## Dataset Handling
- NSL-KDD categories: DoS, Probe, R2L, U2R, Normal
- Keep consistent encoding for categorical features
- Apply the same normalization technique across all notebooks
- Document feature engineering decisions

## Model Training
- Use early stopping to prevent overfitting
- Save model checkpoints during training
- Record hyperparameters for reproducibility
- When comparing models, use the same test set

## Remote Environment
- SSH connections may cause Jupyter notebook editing issues
- If notebook appears read-only, try keyboard shortcuts: Esc then Enter
- For persistent changes, consider editing file directly via terminal
- Save work frequently when working on remote connections

## Memory Bank Updates
- Update activeWorkflow.md after each work session
- Update progress.md when significant milestones are reached
- Document any new patterns or issues in this .aigentrules file
